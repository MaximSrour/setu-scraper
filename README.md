# SETU Data Scraper

The purpose of this project is to enable easier data scraping from the SETU reports provided by Monash university. The data is presented in a HTML/PDF format, making it difficult to extract the data. This code base automates this process and rips that data out to be saved into a CSV file.

More information to come later.

## Testing

Currently, the data scraping fails on some older SETU reports as their formatting has been changed over time. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the future.
